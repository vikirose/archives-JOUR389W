            "rendered": "<p>WASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court Thursday seemed skeptical of former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of absolute presidential immunity from prosecution.</p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is at the center of the case, including his actions leading to the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol. After he was indicted by a federal grand jury, the former president\u2019s attorneys argued that he could not be charged due to having \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>Presidents are immune from civil damages related to the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of their duties, as the high court ruled in 1982, because civil suits could distract the president from his responsibilities. The court has not yet taken a stand on criminal prosecutions related to duties in office.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country,\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.</p>\n<p>Justices seemed focused on how their decision could impact future presidencies, either holding presidents to account or setting up a system that would be open to revenge politics.</p>\n<p>Some justices, including Ketanji Brown Jackson, were concerned that taking away the possibility of criminal prosecution could encourage presidents to engage in more illegal activity.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand what the disincentive is from turning the Oval Office into the seat of criminal activity in this country,\u201d Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Multiple justices \u2013 both liberal and conservative \u2013 appeared unwilling to hold the president to a standard equivalent to the rights of a monarch.</p>\n<p>D. John Sauer, the attorney representing Trump, argued that presidential decisions could be clouded by a fear of criminal<br />\nprosecution.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat looming threat will distort the president\u2019s decision-making precisely when bold and fearless action is most needed,\u201d Sauer said.</p>\n<p>But Jackson countered that many people have jobs where they are expected to make life-and-death consequential decisions in the workplace with the possibility of criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>Other justices were concerned that setting up a system of criminal prosecution could lead to sitting presidents afraid to make difficult decisions, presidents pardoning themselves and politically-driven criminal cases.</p>\n<p>The latter point brought the court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, to a discussion around how motive could be a deciding factor for future criminal cases.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am concerned about future uses of the criminal law to target political opponents based on accusations about their motives,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cWe\u2019re writing a rule for the ages.\u201d</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the justices&#8217; questions centered around how a president\u2019s actions can be classified as either official, subject to immunity, or private, which would not be granted any legal shield.</p>\n<p>Justice Elena Kagan asked Trump\u2019s legal representation, Sauer, whether a president ordering the military to stage a coup would be considered an official act.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat might well be an official act and he would have to be, as I&#8217;ll say in response to all these kinds of hypotheticals, has to be impeached (by the Congress) and convicted before he can be criminally prosecuted,\u201d Sauer said.</p>\n<p>After the 2020 election, Trump, Gorsuch suggested, was at moments acting as an elected official and at others, a candidate.</p>\n<p>Both conservative and liberal justices conceded that a democratic system of government relies on leaders who uphold its legitimacy.</p>\n<p>\u201cA stable, democratic society requires that a candidate who loses an election, even a close one, even a hotly contested one, leave office peacefully if that candidate is the incumbent,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted the layers of protections the judicial system provides for defendants. She asked Michael Dreeben, attorney for Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting Trump in two federal trials, about who bears responsibility for failures in the system.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the end, if it fails completely, it\u2019s because we destroyed democracy on our own, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sotomayor asked. Dreeben agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think one of the ways in which abuses are limited is accountability under the criminal law for criminal violations,\u201d Dreeben replied. \u201cBut the ultimate check is the goodwill and faith in democracy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s federal trial on 2020 election subversion charges has been delayed until the court rules on his claim of presidential immunity.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, whose wife Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Thomas was involved in trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election, did not recuse himself from hearing the case.</p>\n<p>In addition to facing felony counts of falsifying business records to influence the election in his current Manhattan trial, Trump faces criminal charges in Georgia, where he is accused of interfering with the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election results, and in Florida, where he is accused of keeping classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago home.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the high court heard oral arguments in Fischer v. United States, which questioned the applicability of a federal obstruction charge to more than 350 Jan. 6 defendants. Trump was also charged with obstruction in his Jan. 6 case.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court could decide on the cases anytime, but most likely in June or early July.</p>\n",

Traditional country line dancing originated in the folk music of American settlers and was distinct among regions in the United States, according to </span><a href=\"https://grizzlyrose.com/history-of-line-dancing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Grizzly Rose, a decades-old saloon and concert hall in Denver.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> American folk music developed into the country and Western flair we know today.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soul line dancing is similar to country in that it is a group, choreographed dance. However, soul line dancing uses R&amp;B, hip-hop or contemporary music, according to </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/09/22/758395163/soul-line-dancing-come-for-the-fitness-stay-for-the-friendships\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NPR.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It has roots in African and Caribbean culture.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As music has evolved with the times, line dancing has adjusted to fit the culture and genres of the day.

According to the poll, 59% of voters are set on their candidate choice. The poll&#8217;s margin of error ranges from 3.7% to 4.7%.</p>\n<p>Dixon served as the city\u2019s mayor from 2007 to 2010 and is running to reclaim her seat.</p>\n<p>As Scott gears up for his reelection campaign, his job approval rating among all surveyed voters has significantly improved, jumping from 37% in <a href=\"https://www.goucher.edu/hughes-center/documents/Goucher-College-Poll-Fall-2023-Part-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an October poll</a> to 46%.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-XpDAT\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"Surveyed Baltimore City voters show increasing approval for Mayor Brandon Scott\u00a0\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XpDAT/2/\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Grouped Bars\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>\u201cBrandon Scott has improved his standing with the public since our last Goucher College Poll, \u2026His job approval and favorability ratings have both improved, as views toward the direction of the city,\u201d said Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Center for Politics at Goucher College, which conducts the poll.</p>\n<p>Sixty-four percent of surveyed voters are optimistic about Baltimore&#8217;s future. This optimism could be related to the crime reduction under Scott\u2019s administration.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-gvqnu\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"64% of voters are optimistic about the direction Baltimore City is heading\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gvqnu/5/\" width=\"600\" height=\"261\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Crime remains a top concern among Baltimore City voters, with 88% identifying it as a significant issue in the upcoming mayoral election.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-SMJ25\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"Crime and public safety is a major issue for voters\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SMJ25/3/\" width=\"600\" height=\"273\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>\u201cWhile crime is still a key issue, the reduction in the murder rate has been an important accomplishment under the Scott administration,\u201d said Kromer.</p>\n<p>Since Scott took office in 2020, Baltimore has seen a 20% reduction in homicides, representing the city&#8217;s most significant annual drop in history, according to his campaign website. Improper arrests were also cut in half, leading to the city&#8217;s lowest homicide rate in nine years. In his reelection campaign, Scott emphasizes the crime reduction accomplishments under his administration.</p>\n<p>Dixon emphasized the low crime levels under her administration at a news conference in January. She also outlined her crime and public safety plans, including the need to replenish the ranks of city law enforcement and pitch law enforcement as a good, stable career path for the younger generation to attract more talent to the profession, according to The Baltimore Banner.</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s approach differs, focusing on non-policing methods to reduce crime. In 2021, he orchestrated Baltimore City\u2019s $50 million donation to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (MONSE), funding a public health approach to violence prevention, according to a <a href=\"https://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/news/press-releases/2021-10-26-mayor-scott-announces-50-million-violence-prevention-over-three-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release</a> from the City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p>A majority of voters believe drug and substance abuse to be the leading cause of crime in Baltimore, with 83% voting it as a major factor in the issue. Baltimore\u2019s 2023 drug overdose rate was 1039, up from 2022\u2019s 939, according to data from Maryland\u2019s Office of Overdose Response.</p>\n<p>A candidate\u2019s plan or ability to improve public education is also a topic many likely Democratic voters are focusing on. 87% said it\u2019s a significant factor in deciding the candidate.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-9ABx1\" style=\"border: none;\" title=\"Plans to improve public education in Baltimore is a major factor for Democratic voters\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9ABx1/2/\" width=\"600\" height=\"244\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Only 12% of voters rated Baltimore City public schools with a grade of A-B, with 69% unsatisfied with the system, grading it a C-F on a grading scale. 77% of surveyed voters noted underfunded schools and a lack of educational opportunities for younger residents as significant issues facing the city.</p>\n",

(Steph Quinn/Capital News Service)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this morning, she is turning the official street-naming ceremony into a celebration of King\u2019s life. Every other day of the week, she is becoming a full-time community advocate, looking for every small way she can to help others confront the suffering.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She invites more than a dozen kids over for movie nights, home-cooked meals and sleepovers. She helps them search for jobs and figure out what they want to do in life. McKnight said she\u2019s like the \u201ccool mom slash big sister.\u201d She\u2019s there for them to confide in, or when they want help doing the right thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She\u2019s also become a sister to other moms who have lost sons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt&#8217;s just like a support group, where we&#8217;re supporting each other and just trying to just be there for one another,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings comfort to us to know that we&#8217;re not in it alone and that somebody just really understands us.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This month marks the three-year anniversary of King\u2019s death at 13, when he was fatally shot in a Prince George\u2019s County parking lot near an arcade where McKnight had dropped him off to hang out with friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 12-year-old boy confessed to shooting King during a fight with King\u2019s friend over a girl. A judge ordered supervised probation for the boy, who said he didn\u2019t mean to shoot King when his friend handed him a gun in that parking lot. But the sentence and the explanation provided no solace to McKnight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the years since King\u2019s death,\u00a0 McKnight has had more encounters with the justice system than she\u2019d ever imagined possible. She has talked with police, applied for victims\u2019 compensation and sat in court hearings \u2013 for the boy who shot King and for children in foster care, whom she represents as a court appointed special advocate.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has testified about her experience in committee hearings of the Maryland General Assembly. When lawmakers voted this month to expand the list of crimes that automatically send kids as young as 10 to the court system, McKnight agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that change wouldn\u2019t have made much difference in the court hearing of her son\u2019s killer, since violent crimes were already included on that list. And it wouldn\u2019t have made it any easier for McKnight or King\u2019s friends to find resources to work through what happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt will help the next child, though,\u201d McKnight said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The street naming turned into a party to celebrate King\u2019s life. There was a DJ onstage behind a giant photo of King surrounded by balloons. Facing the stage was a semicircle of tables, offering resources on kids\u2019 mental health, job openings with the local fire department and information from a local crime victim\u2019s advocacy organization.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_106517\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106517\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"106517\" data-permalink=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/25/activist-mom-turns-sons-life-into-hopeful-legacy/group_photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/group_photo-scaled-e1713885757898.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2252,1689\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone SE (2nd generation)&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1713610163&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.99&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;20&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00064599483204134&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"group_photo\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;A crowd gathers at the street naming ceremony celebrating the life of King Douglas on April 20, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;A crowd gathers at the street naming ceremony celebrating the life of King Douglas on April 20, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/group_photo-scaled-e1713885757898-300x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/group_photo-scaled-e1713885757898-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-106517\" src=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/group_photo-scaled-e1713885757898-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"A crowd gathers at the street naming ceremony celebrating the life of King Douglas on April 20, 2024.\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/group_photo-scaled-e1713885757898-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/group_photo-scaled-e1713885757898-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/group_photo-scaled-e1713885757898-20x21.jpg 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-106517\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A crowd gathers at the street naming ceremony celebrating the life of King Douglas on April 20, 2024. (Steph Quinn/Capital News Service)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKnight has created her own support program \u2013 for other parents and children whose lives have been rocked by gun violence, and for her own healing \u2013 that is driven by a conviction that tragedy need not beget more tragedy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m dealing with the emotional trauma that they go through,\u201d McKnight said. \u201cMental health awareness \u2013 it needs to be discussed more, and it\u2019s not.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKnight started her mentoring outreach with King\u2019s best friend, who was present the night of King\u2019s killing and lost his father that same year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all the kids touched by King\u2019s death got therapy, even though parents wanted to get them help, so McKnight stepped in \u2013 \u201cjust talking to them, mentoring them, letting them know situations of what I\u2019ve been around and what I went through as a child.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo see your friend get shot and killed laying on the ground at the age of 13 is traumatizing for any child,\u201d McKnight said. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t get them the proper help, then they\u2019re going to act out in whichever way they know how to act out, to be able to let loose of the anger that they\u2019re holding inside.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the kids McKnight mentors have been involved in robberies or carjacking and want to get on a better path.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey\u2019re trying to do right with their lives, but they are in situations where the home life is not well, or they\u2019re around the wrong type of friends,\u201d McKnight said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And McKnight has bonded with a group of women who understood what she was going through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe feel like the world doesn\u2019t know actually how we feel, how we function and how we\u2019re making it on a day-to-day basis after losing our child,\u201d said Tiffani Evans, 36, of Capitol Heights, who lost her son in August 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crystal McNeal, 39, of Washington, D.C., met McKnight at an event where they both shared memories of their children.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe just keep on trying to motivate each other and keep on pushing,\u201d said McNeal, who lost her son to gun violence in July 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyeisha Lucas, 36, of Washington, D.C., said that after the death of her son in October 2022, the group of moms has helped her to be strong for her four other kids.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m only at one year and six months in. They\u2019re like two or three years in. So they keep me strong,\u201d Lucas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Lucas\u2019s son was shot dead on a family member\u2019s porch, victim\u2019s compensation from the D.C. government covered the burial, but Lucas funded other needs, like plates for food, by calling around for donations. She wanted to move from the apartment where she was raising her son, but the assistance she received didn\u2019t cover those expenses.

Wes Moore on Wednesday struck an assured posture on his state\u2019s ability to keep the team in Prince George\u2019s County.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m very confident we\u2019re going to put together the most attractive offer for them,\u201d Moore said in an interview with Capital News Service. \u201cI wish I could predict what they\u2019ll do. But I can tell you the thing I do know is no one is going to put together a better package than the state of Maryland.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore did not mention any rival locales by name, but he did allude to the political divisions that tanked other recent stadium deals in the region.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re unified,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThere is no daylight between the state leadership, local leadership, federal delegation, et cetera \u2013 no daylight. I don\u2019t know if there&#8217;s any other jurisdiction that can make that same claim. And I think that that does and should matter to [the Commanders.]\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Commanders, for their part, are also in active discussion with two other locations \u2013 D.C. and Virginia \u2013 about potential stadium opportunities there, a team spokesperson told CNS this week.

Wes Moore said he has met with several Republicans in Congress to discuss federal support for the response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse and that they have been \u201cincredibly encouraging\u201d about their support for the clean-up effort.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re making it really hard for the Commanders to say no to us,\u201d Rodgers said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many fans would like to see the franchise return to D.C., where it played before relocating to suburban Maryland in 1997. Fans associate the District and the organization\u2019s former home at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium with the team\u2019s Super Bowl-winning glory years of the 1980s and 1990s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D.C.\u2019s bid comes with complications. Its proposal is currently tied up in the U.S. Congress, where </span><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4984/text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a bill</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that would give the city authority to redevelop RFK Stadium is awaiting action in the Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another factor is the </span><a href=\"https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-dc-council-and-monumental-reach-agreement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$515 million D.C. committed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to renovating the downtown arena that hosts the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, following a failed bid by the teams\u2019 owners, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, to relocate the franchises to northern Virginia. The deal raises questions as to how much money might be left over for a Commanders stadium, though the team says it will continue pursuing its options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Commanders remain equally engaged with all three jurisdictions on a new stadium,\u201d team spokesperson Jean Medina said. \u201cThe District has made clear retaining the Capitals and Wizards does not affect their approach, nor does it affect ours.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Virginia, it\u2019s not yet clear what the fallout might be from its foiled effort to bring in the Capitals and Wizards. In December, Gov.

            "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANNAPOLIS, Md.\u2014Gov. Wes Moore said he has met with several Republicans in Congress to discuss federal support for the response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse and that they have been \u201cincredibly encouraging\u201d about their support for the clean-up effort.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He praised the sole Republican in the Maryland delegation in Congress, Rep. Andy Harris, for reaching out to his friends in the conservative Freedom Caucus on behalf of the bridge recovery.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore hasn\u2019t officially sat down with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, even though he showed up at Johnson\u2019s office on Capitol Hill recently, the governor said in an interview. But he said he has personally met with \u201cmultiple Republican chairs of multiple committees.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey&#8217;ve been incredibly encouraging, because they understand that what we&#8217;re asking for in this moment is not for a favor,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe&#8217;re not asking for a charity. Right? We&#8217;re asking for support that a crucial artery for the Port of Baltimore can actually get supported.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore\u2019s comments came during a wide-ranging interview with Capital News Service in his office conference room, where he again called on Congress to take bipartisan action using Maryland as an example.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere&#8217;s something special that we&#8217;re doing here in Maryland, where we really are moving in a sense of collaboration and it&#8217;s not always saying that we agree on everything, we don&#8217;t,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut we move in collaboration, and we move in partnership.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the four weeks since a container ship struck the Key Bridge and brought it crashing down, officials have scrambled to handle the crisis. Maryland\u2019s Congressional delegation </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unveiled a bill </span>requiring the federal government to pay for all costs of rebuilding the bridge.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Joe Biden initially promised full federal funding to rebuild the bridge, with his administration quickly making </span><a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-60-million-emergency-work-wake-collapse-francis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$60 million available</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> upon a </span><a href=\"https://www.mdot.maryland.gov/tso/pages/newsroomdetails.aspx?newsId=775&amp;PageId=38\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">request from the Maryland Department of Transportation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The fate of other funds remains in the hands of Congress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a time when it is challenging for members of Congress to find common ground, Moore said, he is asking them to remember \u201cwho got hurt in this.\u201d He\u2019s also asking them to maintain a sense of urgency in the response.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fully clearing the channel and reopening the Port of Baltimore have been top priorities for Moore as he continues navigating the crisis. A 35-foot deep channel is set to open later this week, Moore announced Tuesday, so several stranded vessels can safely depart.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This channel will only open for a few days and then close as salvage crews work to remove debris perched on the bow of the Dali and stay on track with opening the full channel.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FBI has since opened an investigation into the Dali, but Moore said \u201cin no way, shape or form\u201d will it interfere with reopening the channel and the port. The investigation is important, Moore told CNS, and his team is cooperating with FBI and National Transportation Safety Board investigations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBecause if people are held liable, criminally or otherwise, they need to be held to account,\u201d Moore said. \u201cSomething tragic happened and I think it&#8217;s important that the FBI, the NTSB and everyone else who&#8217;s investigating, they find out what and they find out who&#8217;s responsible.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While managing the biggest crisis the state has faced during his tenure, Moore recalled how tough the first few days after the bridge collapse were. He said he was working on only a couple of hours of sleep each day and barely saw his children.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When his family then sat down for their first dinner together, his son, 10, didn\u2019t quite understand what was happening. But his 12-year-old daughter, he said, asked him a stream of questions and shared things she\u2019d heard at school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore said \u201cthis stuff isn\u2019t easy\u201d for his children, but that he\u2019s trying to see things through their eyes.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve really been so impressed with how they just continue to maintain their humanity and their independence, and also their innocence in all of it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWhich I think has just been really beautiful.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>MORE FROM THE INTERVIEW</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"106590\" data-permalink=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/24/maryland-governor-hopeful-of-gop-support-for-key-bridge-clean-up/dsc_0032-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSC_0032-scaled.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"DSC_0032\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Gov.

            "rendered": "<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; To better understand the ocean surface, NASA scientists went to the stars.</p>\n<p>The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite launched into orbit on Feb. 8 on a quest to better understand the microscopic content of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis mission is really the search for the invisible,\u201d NASA project scientist Jeremy Werdell told Capital News Service.</p>\n<p>Two Maryland teams &#8211; from NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County- and a team from the Netherlands Institute for Space Research and Airbus Netherlands B.V., each worked on one of the three instruments on the satellite.</p>\n<p>Scientists can use PACE\u2019s data, which was first released on April 11, for both short-term monitoring and long-term climate change analysis, according to Werdell. PACE is set to send data back to Earth 12 to 15 times every day.</p>\n<p>The satellite, which is around the size of a minivan, is designed to orbit the Earth for at least three years, but Werdell said the mission might last longer.</p>\n<p>The Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), a project of the Goddard team, will help researchers identify the species of phytoplankton in the oceans by looking at the color of the water across ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light.</p>\n<p>Phytoplankton are a diverse range of plant-like microscopic algae living mostly on the surface of the ocean, according to the project website. While many species of phytoplankton are harmless and are key photosynthesizers, others create toxins harmful to humans and marine life.</p>\n<p>PACE data could help inform water quality managers, as well as the fishing and recreation industries, about the type of phytoplankton in their regions in a more sophisticated way than ever before, Werdell said. From previous satellites, he said, scientists were only able to tell where a community of phytoplankton was, not the type of phytoplankton.</p>\n<p>OCI\u2019s use extends beyond the ocean. The instrument&#8217;s color analysis can be used to track vegetation on land and atmospheric particles, according to project science lead for the mission, Amir Ibrahim.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like to breathe and eat, OCI can help us understand,\u201d Ibrahim said. \u201cOCI is not only going to tell us how the food chain works (and how) the phytoplankton distribution works, but also \u2026climate change.\u201d</p>\n<p>The project will give new insight into how climate change is impacting phytoplankton, and thus the rest of the planet, according to Ibrahim. Phytoplankton produce around half of the oxygen on Earth, according to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.</p>\n<p>To get to the ocean however, scientists must clear the light-reflecting haze between the ocean and the orbiting satellite.</p>\n<p>The two other instruments &#8211; the HARP2 and SPEXone &#8211; are polarimeters, which focus on light bounced off of particles. Both polarimeters, the latter from the Netherlands team, identify particles in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>A team from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County built the HARP2, which is focused on identifying the size and content of particles in aerosols and clouds.</p>\n<p>Vanderlei Martins, the director of the Earth Space Institute and a physics professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said he hopes the HARP2 will be used by other scientists to better understand how the atmosphere interacts with the ocean and land.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hope is that the UMBC contributions \u2026 will help scientists around the world \u2026 have a better understanding of our planet and how it works,\u201d Martins said. \u201cIt\u2019s adding another piece of information to the puzzle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Through the HARP2, scientists can see the size and content of atmospheric droplets.</p>\n<p>The PACE project is years in the making, Werdell said. He joined the project in 2015, just after it was officially launched, but PACE had been discussed for over 20 years.</p>\n<p>Werdell, Martins, Ibrahim and most of the team who spent countless hours working on the satellite all anxiously awaited the launch from the Kennedy Space Center at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>\n<p>Martins was standing with his team on launch day, all intensely watching every update, from the launch until they saw in a live video that their instrument was still tightly secured to the satellite\u2019s side after the launch, and finally when the first transmission came in from space.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s very emotional, every single step,\u201d Martins said.</p>\n<p>After launch day, the team spent months processing and inspecting the quality of the data until it was ready to be released to the public earlier this month.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said that the day the team finally got its hands on the first round of PACE data felt like Christmas morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was like finally, I can see the data, and I really almost teared. That data is really very special,\u201d Ibrahim said.</p>\n",
